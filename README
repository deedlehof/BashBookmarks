A simple bash script for bookmarking directories.
Allows for easy navigation of distinct directories
by letting you create a shortened name to navigate
to them.

Alias the script in your .bashrc to whatever name you
want.  The program uses a text file to store
all of the names and locations of the bookmarks.  
The location of that file is the first line of the file.
Change it to wherever you'd like, it doesn't have to be
the same directory as the script.  Then, simply call
the alias name you gave the program to get the help menu.

It comes with a few simple options
    -a NAME	bookmarks current directory with NAME
    -r NAME	removes the bookmark NAME
    -d		displays all bookmarks in a pager
    -s NAME	searches for a bookmark with NAME
    -h		prints the help menu

To go to a bookmark just call ALIAS BMNAME, where ALIAS
is the name you've given it and BMNAME is the name of a
bookmark.
